              The project Anatomy of Anti-Work Memes analyzes memes as critical
              tools capable of making the toxicity of contemporary work culture
              visible. Through the collection, classification, and
              deconstruction of memes circulating online, the project
              investigates structural problems, recurring behaviors, and shared
              sentiments among workers, showing how these seemingly lighthearted
              contents become powerful instruments of cultural critique.
            </p>
            <p>
              The project is developed primarily through three thematic catalogs
              that collect and interpret 167 memes, selected and analyzed
              through a process of visual and textual deconstruction. This
              approach makes it possible to highlight the different layers of
              meaning present in each meme.

          <div class="project-section__label">Data collection</div>
          <div class="project-section__text">
            <p>
              The dataset was constructed starting from the Instagram profile
              @antiworkmemes, considering content published between 2020 and
              2025. The initial data collection, carried out on October 10,
              2025, using Apify’s Instagram Scraper, produced a dataset of 600
              posts, accompanied by their respective metadata. The contents were
              ordered based on the total number of interactions (calculated as
              the sum of likes and comments), from the highest to the lowest
              value. For the initial analysis, memes exceeding a threshold of
              10,000 total interactions were selected, resulting in 204 posts.
              Subsequently, following the exclusion of duplicate and irrelevant
              content, the dataset was reduced to 167 memes. Each row of the
              dataset represents a single post, from #1 to #167; for each meme,
              the existing data were further supplemented with the image, the
              transcription of the text, and its translation into Italian.
            </p>

          <div class="project-section__text">
            <p>
              The memes were analyzed by breaking down their textual and visual
              components, an operation that made it possible to identify three
              interpretative dimensions capable of describing the toxic culture
              of work: problems related to working conditions and dynamics,
              behaviors enacted by workers, and sentiments expressed in relation
              to their professional experience. For each dimension, the
              following columns were defined within the dataset:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Presence or absence of the interpretative dimension in the meme;</li>
              <li>
                Textual and/or visual portion representative of the problem,
                behavior, or sentiment;
              </li>
              <li>
                Thematic affinity of the dimension: memes are grouped into 14
                categories of problems, 6 of behaviors, and 11 of sentiments.

          <div class="project-section__text">
            <p>
              The categories related to problems describe the main critical
              issues of the labor system as they emerge in anti-work memes. They
              represent structural dysfunctions, abuses, contradictions, and
              inconsistencies in the organization of work, highlighting what
              makes the work experience toxic or unsustainable. Taken together,
              they provide a map of the recurring tensions that run through
              contemporary work.
            </p>
            <p>
              The identified categories are: Overlong shifts, Poor management,
              Meetings, Hiring, Capitalism, Interpersonal relationships,
              Billionaires, Work demands, Unhealthy environment, Pointless work,
              Working system, Underpayment, Retirement plans, Paid time off.

          <div class="project-section__label">Behaviors</div>
          <div class="project-section__text">
            <p>
              The behavior categories represent the ways in which workers react
              to, resist, or adapt to problematic working conditions. Individual
              and collective strategies emerge, along with attitudes of
              detachment, irony, resignation, or opposition, showing how people
              deal on a daily basis with the toxicity of work and attempt to
              reconfigure their role within it.
            </p>
            <p>
              The behavior categories include: Avoidance mode, Workplace
              revelations, Mission: survival, The art of not being exploited,
              Violence is the solution, Play pretend.

          <div class="project-section__text">

              The feelings categories represent the emotional reactions
              associated with the experience of work as narrated in anti-work
              memes. Rather than classifying emotions in a psychological sense,
              these categories describe what the sentiments are directed toward:
              moments, dynamics, expectations, or working conditions. What
              emerges is a complex emotional landscape that highlights the
              affective—and often conflictual—relationship between individuals
              and work culture.
            </p>
            <p>
              The identified categories are: People are the problem, It’s about
              money, Fuck capitalism, Mission: not working, Hiring circus, Lower
              your expectations, I hate my job, I don’t care about my job, Time
              trap, Burnout core, Poor management.

              sentiments present in the memes. Through a questionnaire, the user
              places a stamp on the meme they consider representative of a given
              category indicated in the question.
