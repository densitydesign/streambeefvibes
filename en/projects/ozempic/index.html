              The installation investigates how credibility and pharmaceutical
              legitimacy are constructed on TikTok through content about
              Ozempic, a prescription drug for type 2 diabetes that is
              increasingly framed online as a lifestyle and weight-loss
              solution.
            </p>
            <p>
              The artifact consists of ten explorable medicine-style boxes, each
              corresponding to a specific credibility strategy performed by
              creators on TikTok. Inside each box, fold-out cards collect
              transcribed speech, visual frames, engagement metrics, and
              strategy indicators derived from the analyzed videos.
            </p>
            <p>
              The dataset includes around 160 publicly available U.S.-based
              TikTok videos, collected between 2024 and 2025 through seven
              Ozempic-related search queries. Videos were ranked by engagement,
              and the top 100 were selected for in-depth analysis.
            </p>
            <p>
              Data operations included frame-by-frame visual analysis, verbatim
              transcription, sentence-level linguistic coding, and
              multi-dimensional classification. Visual elements (settings,
              objects, emotional performance) and linguistic features (themes,
              narrative modes, tone, credibility type) were first analyzed
              separately and then remixed to identify ten integrated
              credibility-performing strategies.
            </p>
            <p>
              The installation presents a selection of evidence cards from the
              100 videos, organized by strategy rather than chronology. The
              focus is on how visual cues and language combine to perform
              medical authority and lived experience, influencing how audiences
              evaluate trust in short-form health content.
            </p>
            <p>
              The exhibition artifact is the result of a multi-step process:
              data collection, transformation, classification, and visual
              translation. TikTok was chosen for its central role in
              contemporary health discourse and for its short-video format,
              which intensifies performances of trust, expertise, and
              transformation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Using Apify TikTok Scraper, multiple scraping rounds were run with
              seven carefully designed queries, including clinical terms
              (“GLP1”, “Semaglutide”), lifestyle frames (“Ozempic Journey”,
              “Ozempic Weightloss”), side-effect narratives (“Ozempic Face”),
              and brand names (“Ozempic”, “Mounjaro”, “Wegovy”). This produced a
              corpus of about 160 videos.
            </p>
            <p>
              From this corpus, videos were ranked using engagement metrics such
              as views and likes, used as proxies for cultural relevance. The
              top 100 were selected for qualitative analysis. The methodology
              then split into two parallel streams: visual and linguistic
              credibility analysis.

          <h2 class="project-section__title">Visual stream</h2>
          <div class="project-section__text">
            <p>
              In the visual stream, each video was viewed repeatedly and
              analyzed frame by frame. We systematically documented: settings
              (clinical spaces, domestic interiors, public or hybrid
              environments), objects and symbols (medical devices,
              pharmaceutical packaging, professional clothing, everyday outfits),
              narrative structures (before/after, progress tracking,
              instructional demonstrations, emotional storytelling), and
              emotional performance (confidence, vulnerability, humor,
              authority). Through iterative comparison, nine recurring visual
              categories emerged.

          <h2 class="project-section__title">Linguistic stream</h2>
          <div class="project-section__text">
            <p>
              In the linguistic stream, all videos containing spoken narration
              were transcribed, while videos based only on background music or
              on-screen text were excluded. Transcriptions were generated during
              scraping through Apify TikTok Scraper, which extracts
              speech-to-text transcripts when available in video metadata.
            </p>
            <p>
              All transcripts were then normalized for readability. Here,
              “normalization” does not mean rewriting or interpretation, but
              minimal linguistic cleanup to make texts readable and comparable
              across videos.
            </p>
            <p>
              Normalization included spelling, punctuation, spacing, and
              sentence-splitting corrections, while preserving original lexicon,
              sequence, tone, colloquial expressions, and spoken style.
            </p>
            <p>
              This phase was carried out using ChatGPT with a fixed prompt
              designed to avoid semantic or stylistic alteration.
            </p>
            <p>
              From normalized transcripts, short quotes were manually selected
              where credibility was actively performed rather than merely
              mentioned. These excerpts were coded along four analytical
              dimensions: theme (14 categories), narrative cluster (5
              categories), linguistic tone (23 indicators), and credibility type
              (4 performative modes).

              The crucial methodological step was remixing these two analytical
              streams. Instead of presenting visual and linguistic categories
              separately, we examined how specific combinations of imagery,
              settings, tones, and themes systematically recurred in
              high-engagement videos. Through this synthesis, we identified ten
              overall credibility-performing strategies that integrate visual and
              linguistic elements into coherent performances.

              The final installation translates these strategies into a physical,
              explorable format. Ten medicine-style boxes echo the clinical
              aesthetics often adopted by creators themselves. Inside, fold-out
              cards present frames from the 100 analyzed videos, including
              transcripts, representative images, strategy labels, and
              engagement metrics. Cards are designed for active handling,
              reflecting TikTok’s incremental reveal logic and encouraging
              visitors to reflect on their own judgment processes.
