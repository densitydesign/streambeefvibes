              The project “Tradwives Commandments – Rules for Women’s Happy
              Ending” is an editorial artifact that examines the U.S. Tradwife
              trend on TikTok through the series “How to Become a Tradwife,”
              structured in two collections.
            </p>
            <p>
              The “Commandments” collection organizes quotations from 174 TikTok
              videos published by 44 accounts into 18 books. Each book focuses
              on one commandment prescribing women’s behavior and life choices.
              These commandments are grouped into five broader categories,
              called “Doctrines,” visually identified by each book’s cover
              color.
            </p>
            <p>
              The “Holy Cards” collection gathers images of husbands and
              children from 65 TikTok posts by 18 accounts, showing how marriage
              and motherhood are presented as the core of female identity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Overall, the artifact reveals a normative system that promotes
              obedience through promises of happiness and implicit threats.
            </p>
          </div>

              The exhibition artifact was designed through a qualitative
              transformation of collected content. Starting from each video’s
              transcript, significant textual fragments were manually extracted
              to capture the core concepts in Tradwife discourse and to expose,
              more or less explicitly, the conservative ideology underpinning
              the trend.
            </p>
            <p>
              Quotations were then compared and connected, linking different
              statements to a defined set of recurring normative claims.
              Referencing the religious imagery that characterizes the trend,
              these claims were rhetorically translated into “commandments”:
              metaphorical and dogmatic formulations that define what women
              should or should not do according to Tradwives.

              Commandments were organized into five doctrines representing five
              macro-categories and chronologically ordered stages of women’s
              lives: from giving up individual independence, through faith,
              modesty, and silence, to marriage and motherhood.

              Each commandment takes the form of a catalog with a variable
              number of quotations but a fixed internal structure of three
              chapters, where extracted quotes are organized into subcategories
              and clusters.

              Chapter 01 “Because...” collects claims that explain why women

            <p>
              Chapter 02 “So that...” gathers promised positive outcomes
              (emotional, relational, economic, or physical), framed as direct
              consequences of obedience.
            </p>
            <p>
              Chapter 03 “Otherwise...” collects claims linking non-adherence to
              negative outcomes such as personal failure, instability, or
              suffering.

              Some quotations directly reference husbands and children. These
              references activate cross-links to the second collection, “Holy
              Cards,” made of two visual books: “Worthy Men” and “Perfect
              Children.” These collect and classify screenshots extracted from
              U.S. Tradwife TikTok videos, categorizing men and children by
              roles and actions. Cross-references between text and images show
              how the visual presence of these subjects supports and legitimizes
              the gender hierarchies promoted by the trend.

              The imaginary built through Tradwife discourse and visuals
              reinforces traditional gender roles, presenting them as a peaceful
              solution to the frustration and frenzy of modern society.

              In the final part of the artifact, visitors take part in two short
              activities in the Feedback Notebooks at the end of the table. They
              are asked to complete two printed sentences by placing colored
              stickers next to definitions that best complete them. These
              activities highlight key ideas explored by the artifact: Tradwife
              identity is rooted in traditional gender roles and relational
              bonds, and according to this ideology every woman should follow
              this model to reach a “happy ending.”
