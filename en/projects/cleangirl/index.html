              The project is an installation that analyzes the problems related
              to the clean girl aesthetic voiced by the users commenting the
              influencers’ videos, consisting of a physical display (a wall of
              printed comments) and a video.
            </p>
            <p>
              The comments wall is made of 705 selected comments to TikTok
              videos published by clean girl influencers, which describe what
              users feel they lack in order to fit into the “clean girl”
              aesthetic.
            </p>
            <p>
              The video aims to showcase and provide context for the comments
              displayed on the wall, allowing the audience to understand the
              trend's problematic origins before they become explicit.
              Initially, the clean girl archetype is presented, highlighting
              who these creators are, what they do, and the lifestyle they
              promote. For this reason, unlike the physical installation which
              lists the comments alone, the video incorporates visual and audio
              elements from content selected via the #cleangirlaesthetic. The
              ultimate goal is to introduce the clean girl phenomenon by
              presenting how the categories used to organize the comments on the
              wall originated.
            </p>
            <p>
              The data comes from 30 TikTok videos with the hashtag
              #cleangirlaesthetic (2023-2025) from influencers in the US and UK.
              The comments were collected and manually classified into five
              categories (Appearance, Status, Motivation, Provenance, and
              Intersections) based on recurring traits. In the artifact, the
              comments are organized by category and tagged by an Insecurity
              Element, showing how the ideal of “clean” beauty, presented as
              natural and authentic, is in reality exclusive and linked to
              specific aesthetic, economic, and cultural standards,
              continuously reinforced by the imagery of influencers.

              The artefact displays 705 comments manually extracted from 30
              TikTok videos by US/UK influencers, expressing the shortcomings
              perceived by users. Each comment was translated in Italian and
              English. We began with manual collection of the comments (which
              was simplified by looking for specific keywords expressing lack
              such as “I wish,” “can't,” “cry” to identify certain comments)
              and continued with the classification of each comment into five
              main Categories of Lack:
            </p>
            <p>
              Appearance: concerns about physical appearance. For example:
              “I wish my skin was this perfect”; “If I were like you, I would
              never complain about my body again, you’re so cute”.
            </p>
            <p>
              Status: issues related to economic and financial condition. For
              example: “You called me poor in thirty thousand languages”; “I
              was already feeling poor with so many products, then when she
              launched a Chanel soap I was sure that I am extremely poor”.
            </p>
            <p>
              Motivation: behavioral and motivational issues. For example:
              “People with depression often struggle to find the motivation to
              bathe; we don’t all have the same privileges”; “I wish i could
              just look like this effortlessly”.
            </p>
            <p>
              Provenance: difficulties related to origin or cultural
              background. For example: “I just want to be a white girl in
              Alabama”; “I wish I were white so I could be a clean girl”.
            </p>
            <p>
              Intersections: comments that refer to more than one category. For
              example: “Oh to be white and blond”; “If I had this all money to
              spend, I think I could buy a whole new skin”.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each comment was further categorized by an Insecurity Element
              (e.g., body, money, ...), identified by an Insecurity Trait (e.g
              skin, depression, lazy, ...). So, for example, the comment: “My
              dark circles ruin it all for me” is categorized in this way:
              Category: Appearance; Insecurity Element: face; Insecurity Trait:
              dark circles.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="project-section__label">The wall of comments</div>
          <div class="project-section__text">
            <p>
              The wall of comments presents the 705 comments ordered first by
              main Category (from left to right) and inside each category by
              Insecurity Element, ensuring that all comments with a common theme
              (e.g., Appearance - BODY) are placed side by side.
            </p>
            <p>
              The comments layout reflects the minimalist, essential, and
              orderly aesthetic of the “clean girl” (serif typography, pastel
              colors), with Italian as main language, the English translation
              smaller placed below it and the Insecurity Trait highlighted in
              italics and in the color of its respective category.
            </p>

          <div class="project-section__label">The video</div>
          <div class="project-section__text">
            <p>
              The video was developed by integrating generative AI technologies,
              starting from an aesthetic analysis of the ten influencers
              selected for the research. Among these, Daisy Herriot
              (@daisyherriot) was chosen as the central figure as she is one of
              the influencers with the largest following and the one who most
              faithfully embodies the clean girl aesthetic; her face was
              therefore used as the basis for synthesizing the ideal image of
              the typical clean girl. Using Google Flow and Veo 3.1, five video
              contents were generated: a neutral introduction with a start timer
              and four thematic videos. Each clip strictly reflects the color
              palettes, actions, and props distinctive to the identified
              categories (physical appearance, status, motivation, and origin).
              The narrative is supported by a selection of clips extracted and
              deconstructed from the 30 original videos in the analysis,
              structured to answer guiding questions that accompany the user
              from the definition of the phenomenon to the data visualization.
