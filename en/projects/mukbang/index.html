          <div class="project-section__text">
            <p>
              Mukbang is a digital phenomenon that originated in South Korea in
              the late 2000s, where a streamer consumes large amounts of food
              in front of the camera while interacting with the audience.
              Initially a form of virtual companionship during meals, mukbang
              has evolved into shorter, more visually intense videos that
              combine entertainment, food aesthetics, ASMR, and performance.
              The result is a visual language capable of evoking a wide range
              of emotions: from pleasure to curiosity, from hunger to
              repulsion.
            </p>
            <p>
              This installation project explores how behind the visual spectacle
              of Mukbang’s excessive eating lies a complex social space in
              which users seek connection, emotional support, and ways to
              navigate their everyday routines and challenges with food. To map
              the emotional and behavioural patterns of the community, the
              project organises 107 comments from YouTube and Reddit into four
              main categories, distinguished by different colours and further
              divided into sub-categories.
            </p>
            <p>
              It consists of a printed catalogue and a complementary video that
              translates user comments on mukbang videos into a structured
              narrative about food, emotions, and digital intimacy. Alongside
              the catalogues and the video, an interactive section allows
              visitors to match comments to categories, directly experiencing
              the process of classification.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h2 class="project-section__title">Data Design</h2>
          <div class="project-section__label">Data collection</div>
          <div class="project-section__text">
            <p>
              The project is based on a qualitative and fully manual
              transformation of user comments, treating them as personal,
              situated statements rather than abstract data points. No automated
              tools, such as sentiment analysis or keyword extraction, were used
              in the selection phase.
            </p>
            <p>
              Following data collection, comments were selected through close
              reading, focusing exclusively on explicit declarations where the
              user's feeling was unequivocally stated. Comments that were
              ambiguous or required personal interpretation were discarded.
            </p>
            <p>
              Inclusion logic: The comment “So satisfying keep up the good work
              👍” was selected because it provides an unambiguous record of
              satisfaction, a key sub-category under Feelings and Sensations.
              In parallel, the selection aimed to document eating habits. A
              representative example is: “Whenever I feel hungry I just watch
              people eat food and I’m not hungry anymore. Phantom food”. This
              was included because it details a specific functional behavior—
              using visual stimuli to suppress physical hunger—serving as
              primary evidence for the Appetite Management category.
            </p>
            <p>
              Exclusion logic: Conversely, comments like “watching this after 2
              hours of cardio and enjoying my meal, perfect timing :D” were
              discarded. In cases like this, the ironic tone obscures the true
              motivation or emotional state of the user, making it unsuitable
              for the dataset.
            </p>

          <div class="project-section__label">Data processing</div>
          <div class="project-section__text">
            <p>
              The first step in data processing involved thematic sorting, in
              which each comment was assigned to one or more of the four
              resulting categories:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Feelings and sensations: spontaneous physical reactions, such as
                food cravings or satisfaction, generated by watching mukbang
                videos (e.g. “You make me hungry 🤤”).
              </li>
              <li>
                Motivations: Explicitly stated reasons for watching, focusing on
                intentional behavioral patterns rather than implied interests
                (e.g. “Who came just because of Ramadan and because they
                hungry”).
              </li>
              <li>
                Appetite management: The functional use of videos as a tool to
                regulate hunger or assist in daily eating routines (e.g. “as
                someone with a very bad eating disorder, zach really helped me
                find food more appetising”).
              </li>
              <li>
                Disembodiment: Experiences of bodily detachment, where watching
                another person eat provides a vicarious sense of fullness and
                satisfaction (e.g. “When I’m hungry I just watch mukbangs and
                I’m satisfied”).
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Overlaps between categories were preserved to reflect the
              complexity of users’ experiences, rather than forcing comments
              into a single interpretative frame.

              Comments are organised into the main four categories, which are
              further articulated into more specific sub-categories to increase
              the precision of the classification. For instance, Motivations
              are broken down (among others) into religious fasting, dietary
              restrictions, companionship, and hunger, while Feelings and
              sensations include guilt, disapproval, joy, relaxation, and
              satisfaction.

              The spatial configuration completes the transformation process. In
              front of the screen, a table displays two copies of the catalogue,
              while on the right-hand side, an interactive section allows
              visitors to participate in the cataloguing process by actively
              matching comments to categories and sub-categories.

              Guided by a legend and instructions, visitors participate in a
              practical classification exercise: they will draw a card, which
              identifies a category and a sub-category, and will have to match
              it to one of the five comments in the dataset, each placed on top
              of a box. Since the cards to be drawn show a random mix of all
              categories and sub-categories, and the boxes show five comments to
              which multiple cards can be matched, the task requires visitors to
              actively apply the classification logic of the project.
